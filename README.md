# Collatz-Conjecture
This is the automation of the Collatz conjecture, which is popularly known as 3n + 1 conjecture in number theory.
It involves an iterative process. At first a number n is entered. In each step, if the n is even, the new number is 2n. If it is odd the new number is 3n + 1.
The conjecture states every natural number will eventually reach 1 through the above iterative process. Try a few numbers yourself using my code!
